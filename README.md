I designed Six FIFA Player Cards with the intention of placing them in pairs using the flex-wrap property.

The PlayerList component which is the parent component of the Player.js is rendered in the root component App.js

An array of object was creadted in players.js as instructed and is referenced from the PlayerList component and the player details are passed as props to the Player.js.

In the Player.js, a react-boostrap Card is created to style the Player cards and all props were destructured and assigned default values.
